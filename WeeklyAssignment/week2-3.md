## Game idea A
- For The Treasure (FTT)
As a tribute to the essence of the classic strategy game For The King, For The Treasure is a lightweight single-player Roguelike focused on high-frequency decision-making and fast-paced adventure. Players simultaneously control two complementary heroes on a procedurally generated hex-grid map. Movement is governed by the "Dice of Fate," where the points rolled determine not only the boundaries of exploration but also the strategic weight given to random equipment drops, sudden encounters, and resource management. With an integrated save feature, players can refine their routes within a single run, maximizing the value of every turn through tactical role allocation in a world where every step is filled with uncertainty.
The combat system utilizes an original "point-driven logic" to transform dice randomness into deep tactical gameplay. Unlike traditional stat-based combat, success rates, damage multipliers, and bonus effects (such as Stun or Burn) are determined directly by the dice results. The most core mechanic is the "Fixed-Point Skill" system: certain game-changing high-tier abilities or team buffs can only be unleashed by rolling a precise, specific value. This forces players to constantly evaluate probabilities while managing two characters, balancing between consistent, safe output and gambling on high-reward "Fixed-Point Ultimates"—making every roll a psychological duel between risk control and explosive timing.

## Game idea B
- Artillery Chaos (AC)
Artillery Chaos is a 2D physics-based tactical shooter that pays homage to the classic "terrain destruction" and "parabolic ballistics" of Worms. The game focuses on high-stakes environmental manipulation and unpredictable chain reactions. Players command a squad of three specialized "Demolition Experts" on a fully destructible vertical map, where the environment itself is the most lethal weapon. Victory is achieved not just through direct hits, but by strategically collapsing platforms or trapping opponents in craters.

The combat system features "Dynamic Gravity Ballistics", where wind speed and gravitational pull shift in real-time, affecting every projectile's trajectory. Beyond standard rockets, players can deploy "Drill Mines," "Gravity Singularities," or "Airstrike Beacons." These tools often trigger unexpected terrain collapses, turning a solid vantage point into a deadly abyss in a single turn.

Core Mechanic: Structural Collapse
Unlike traditional shooters, the heart of the experience lies in Destruction Feedback. When explosives destroy the "key support nodes" of a structure, the remaining terrain above obeys physics and falls, crushing or displacing any characters in its path. This forces players to constantly evaluate the map's structural integrity, balancing between "Precision Sniping" and "Massive Demolition." Every shot is a gamble between perfect geometry and chaotic physics, making every match a tactical demolition derby.
